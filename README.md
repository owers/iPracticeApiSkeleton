# iPractice Technical Assignment Project 📚

This repository hosts the project for the technical assignment, which is a simple ASP.NET Core API utilizing SQLite as the database.

The project includes:
- An initial migration to create the database and seed it with predefined data. 🧱
- Additional migrations to support booking and availability tables. 📅
- Two controllers with the requested endpoints. 🚀
- Models representing ORM mapped entities. 📦
- A service handling availability and booking related operations. 👩‍💻
- Documentation and failure mode handling. 📖

The project was upgraded to .NET 8.0 and a test project structure was created, but the quality assurance framework was not fully implemented. The project was developed on M1 Silicon, requiring a launch configuration change. 🍎

The project is not optimized and is not suitable for production use. Possible areas for improvement include optimizing queries, entities, and representations, such as storing availability slices instead of computing them on demand. 🚧
